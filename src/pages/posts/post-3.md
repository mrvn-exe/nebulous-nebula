# Creating components and using them to refacture

Published on: 15.07.2025

In this post I'll quickly tell you about how I learned to use components.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Creating reusable components**: I learned how to create my own components in Astro. I started with simple ones like `Header`, `Footer`, `Navigation` und `Socials`.

2. **Using components to refactor code**: By moving repeated code into components, my pages became much cleaner and easier to maintain. For example, the navigation bar and footer are now their own components and can be reused on every page.

3. **Passing props and customizing**: I also learned how to pass props to components, so I can customize things like links or social media profiles for each page.

## What's next

I plan to create even more components and keep refactoring my site. My goal is to make my code as modular and maintainable as possible. Stay tuned for more updates!
