# Styling with CSS on a local and global scope

Published on: 14.07.2025

While following the tutorial on how to work with the Astro framework, I learned how to style a page with CSS!

## What I've accomplished

1. **Styling in a local scope**: First, I styled the heading **`<h1>`** in purple and with a font size of 4rem. Then I styled the bullet points of my skills to navy color and all-caps by using variables in my frontmatter.

2. **Styling in a global scope**: I then created the **`global.css`** for global CSS styling. In this file I defined the `background-color, font-family` and the `body` of every page.

3. **Playing around with my new skills**: Lastly, I just played around a little bit and tweaked other headers, some styling and I updated my front page.
